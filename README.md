# Welcome to the PHP Starter!

This project is pre-configured with some useful Twilio functionality using the [Twilio helper library for PHP](https://github.com/twilio/twilio-php).

## Setting Up
If you're in need of a PHP development environment, the quickest way to get one set up is to use [MAMP on OS X](http://www.mamp.info/en/index.html) or [XAMPP on Windows (or Linux)](http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-windows.html).  Follow the instructions on their respective websites to download and install their software.

Once you have a local PHP stack you are happy with, either dump the contents of this project's `www` directory into your server's web root, or configure your Apache server to serve files out of the `www` directory as the web root.  Using MAMP, this looks like this:

...and then this...

![web root](http://demo.kevinwhinnery.com/upload/MAMP-20130827-143227.png)

Then, start your servers by clicking the "Start Servers" button - on MAMP it looks like this after starting:

![servers](http://demo.kevinwhinnery.com/upload/MAMP-20130827-143407.png)

Now, navigate to the `www` folder of this project.  Rename `config.php.sample` to `config.php`.  Open this file and locate the following three lines of configuration:

    <?php
    $TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID = 'CHANGE_ME';
    $TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN  = 'CHANGE_ME';
    $TWILIO_NUMBER = 'CHANGE_ME';

These values inside quotes will need to be replaced with the following information from your Twilio account:

* `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` : Your Twilio "account SID" - it's like your username for the Twilio API.  This and the auth token (below) can be found [on your account dashboard](https://www.twilio.com/user/account).
* `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` : Your Twilio "auth token" - it's your password for the Twilio API.  This and the account SID (above) can be found [on your account dashboard](https://www.twilio.com/user/account).
* `TWILIO_NUMBER` : A Twilio number that you own, that can be used for making calls and sending messages.  You can find a list of phone numbers you control (and buy another one, if necessary) [in the account portal](https://www.twilio.com/user/account/phone-numbers/incoming).

Now your project should be all set!

## Running the Application

If you successfully started your MAMP or XAMPP server, it is likely to be running locally on [port 8080](http://localhost:8080/).  Navigate to [this page](http://localhost:8080/), and you should find a UI which looks similar to this:

Try out the voice and messaging demos by entering your mobile phone number and pressing the button.  If you receive a voice call and a text message from your Twilio number, you're all set!
